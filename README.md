# VFM-for-hyperelastic-materials
This code is based on The VFM and can be used to idenfify the nonhomogenous hyperelastic property distribution of solids. The theoretical aspects are presented in "FEniCS implementation of the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) for nonhomogeneous hyperelastic identification". 
This code is working on the framework of Fenics. Please first make sure Fenics is installed.
